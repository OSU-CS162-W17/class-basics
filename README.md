Class basics
============

This repo contains some code demonstrating the basics of C++ classes.  You can find class declarations in the `.hpp` files and class implementations in the corresponding `.cpp` files.

There are a few different examples here, each in a different set of files:
  * `point.hpp` and `point.cpp` contain the interface and implementation of a basic class representing a point in 2D space.  This class demonstrates some of the most basic essentials of C++ classes, including the syntax for declaring and implementing a class and its methods, the different types of class constructors, accessors, and mutators, etc.  There is an application in `point-stuff.cpp` that demonstrates basic class usage using this `Point` class.

  * `student.hpp` and `student.cpp` contain the interface and implementation of a class representing a student.  This class demonstrates some of more advanced class essentials, especially ones related to classes that use dynamically allocated members.  When you have a class like this, you typically need to implement a copy constructor, an assignment operator, and a destructor, as we do for the `Student` class.  There is an application in `student-stuff.cpp` that demonstrates the usage of this class.

You can compile this code using the provided makefile and then run it as follows:
```
make
./point_stuff
./student_stuff
```
You can also run the command `make clean` to clean up the directory of files generated by compilation.
